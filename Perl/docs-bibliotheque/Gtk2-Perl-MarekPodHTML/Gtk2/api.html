Gtk2::api - Mapping the Gtk+ C API to perl
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="ABSTRACT">ABSTRACT</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The Gtk2 module attempts to stick as close as is reasonable to the C API,
to minimize the need to maintain documentation which is nearly a copy of
the C API reference documentation.  However, the world is not perfect, and
the mappings between C and perl are not as clean and predictable as you 
might wish.  Thus, this page described the basics of how to map the C API to
the perl API, and lists various points in the API which follow neither the
C API documentation nor the mapping principles.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The canonical documentation is the C API reference at
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gtk/ and
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gdk/
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
There are two main sections: &#39;BINDING BASICS&#39; describes the principles on which
the bindings work; understanding these can lead you to guess the proper syntax
to use for any given function described in the C API reference.  The second
section lists various specific points of difference which don&#39;t necessarily
correspond with what you expect; this section is in three main parts: missing
methods, renamed methods, and different call signatures.
</p>
<h2 class="POD_HEAD1"><a name="BINDING_BASICS">BINDING BASICS</a></h2>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
We avoid deprecated APIs.  Many functions refer to C concepts which are alien
to the bindings.  Many things have replacements.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Deprecated_Stuff_Isn">Deprecated Stuff Isn&#39;t Bound</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Things that were marked as deprecated at gtk+ 2.0.0 do not appear in the
bindings.  This means that gtk+-1.x&#39;s GtkCList, GtkTree, and GtkText are
not available.  The notable exception is GtkList, which is available solely
in support of GtkCombo (which was itself replaced by GtkComboBox in 2.4);
it should not be used under any other circumstances.  If you <i>really</i> need
access to these old widgets, search the web for <code>Gtk2::Deprecated</code>.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Some other things were deprecated during the gtk+ 2.x series, e.g.
GtkOptionMenu was deprecated in favor of GtkComboBox in 2.4.  Things that were
marked as deprecated during the 2.x series will not be removed, basically
because older versions do not have the replacements, and removing them would
break backward compatibility.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Namespaces_and_Objec">Namespaces and Objects</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The namespaces of the C libraries are mapped to perl packages according to
scope, although in some cases the distinction may seem rather arbitrary:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
 g_ =&gt; Glib  (the Glib module - distributed separately)
 gtk_ =&gt; Gtk2
 gdk_ =&gt; Gtk2::Gdk
 gdk_pixbuf_ =&gt; Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf
 pango_ =&gt; Gtk2::Pango
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Objects get their own namespaces, in a way, as the concept of the GType is
completely replaced in the perl bindings by the perl package name.  This goes
for GBoxed, GObject, and even things like Glib::String and Glib::Int (which are
needed for specifying column types in the Gtk2::TreeModel).  (Flags and
enums are special -- see below.)
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
 GtkButton =&gt; Gtk2::Button
 GdkPixbuf =&gt; Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf
 GtkScrolledWindow =&gt; Gtk2::ScrolledWindow
 PangoFontDescription =&gt; Gtk2::Pango::FontDescription
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
With this package mapping and perl&#39;s built-in method lookup, the bindings can
do object casting for you.  This gives us a rather comfortably object-oriented
syntax, using normal perl syntax semantics:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  in C:
    GtkWidget * b;
    b = gtk_check_button_new_with_mnemonic (&quot;_Something&quot;);
    gtk_toggle_button_set_active (GTK_TOGGLE_BUTTON (b), TRUE);
    gtk_widget_show (b);

  in perl:
    my $b = Gtk2::CheckButton-&gt;new (&#39;_Something&#39;);
    $b-&gt;set_active (1);
    $b-&gt;show;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You see from this that constructors for most widgets which allow mnemonics
will use mnemonics by default in their &quot;new&quot; methods.  For those who don&#39;t
guess this right off, Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic is also available.
Cast macros are not necessary, and your code is a lot shorter.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Flags_and_Enums">Flags and Enums</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Constants are handled as strings, because it&#39;s much more readable than numbers,
and because it&#39;s automagical thanks to the GType system.  Constants are
referred to by their nicknames; basically, strip the common prefix, lower-case
it, and optionally convert &#39;_&#39; to &#39;-&#39;:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL =&gt; &#39;toplevel&#39;
  GTK_BUTTONS_OK_CANCEL =&gt; &#39;ok-cancel&#39; (or &#39;ok_cancel&#39;)
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Flags are a special case.  You can&#39;t (sensibly) bitwise-or these
string-constants, so you provide a reference to an array of them instead.
Anonymous arrays are useful here, and an empty anonymous array is a simple
way to say &#39;no flags&#39;.
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  FOO_BAR_BAZ | FOO_BAR_QUU | FOO_BAR_QUUX =&gt; [qw/baz quu qux/]
  0 =&gt; []
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In some cases you need to see if a bit is set in a bitfield; methods
returning flags therefore return an overloaded object.  See <a class="POD_LINK" href="../Glib.html">Glib</a> for
more details on which operations are allowed on these flag objects, but
here is a quick example:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
 in C:
  /* event-&gt;state is a bitfield */
  if (event-&gt;state &amp; GDK_CONTROL_MASK) g_printerr (&quot;control was down\n&quot;);

 in perl:
  # $event-&gt;state is a special object
  warn &quot;control was down\n&quot; if $event-&gt;state &amp; &quot;control-mask&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
But this also works:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  warn &quot;control was down\n&quot; if $event-&gt;state * &quot;control-mask&quot;;
  warn &quot;control was down\n&quot; if $event-&gt;state &gt;= &quot;control-mask&quot;;
  warn &quot;control and shift were down\n&quot;
                            if $event-&gt;state &gt;= [&quot;control-mask&quot;, &quot;shift-mask&quot;];
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
And treating it as an array of strings (as in older versions) is still
supported:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  warn &quot;control was down\n&quot; if grep /control-mask/, @{ $event-&gt;state };
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The gtk stock item stuff is a little different -- the GTK_STOCK_* constants
are actually macros which evaluate to strings, so they aren&#39;t handled by the
mechanism described above; you just specify the string, e.g., 
GTK_STOCK_OK =&gt; &#39;gtk-ok&#39;. The full list of stock items can be found at 
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtk-Stock-Items.html
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Memory_Handling">Memory Handling</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The functions for ref&#39;ing and unref&#39;ing objects and free&#39;ing boxed structures
are not even mapped to perl, because it&#39;s all handled automagically by the
bindings.  I could write a treatise on how we&#39;re handling reference counts and
object lifetimes, but all you need to know as perl developer is that it&#39;s
handled for you, and the object will be alive so long as you have a perl scalar
pointing to it or the object is referenced in another way, e.g. from a container.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The only thing you have to be careful about is the lifespan of non
reference counted structures, which means most things derived from
<code>Glib::Boxed</code>.  If it comes from a signal callback it might be good
only until you return, or if it&#39;s the insides of another object then
it might be good only while that object lives.  If in doubt you can
<code>copy</code>.  Structs from <code>copy</code> or <code>new</code> are yours and live as long as
referred to from Perl.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Callbacks">Callbacks</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Use normal perl callback/closure tricks with callbacks.  The most common use
you&#39;ll have for callbacks is with the Glib <code>signal_connect</code> method:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  $widget-&gt;signal_connect (event =&gt; \&amp;event_handler, $user_data);
  $button-&gt;signal_connect (clicked =&gt; sub { warn &quot;hi!\n&quot; });
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
$user_data is optional, and with perl closures you don&#39;t often need it
(see <u>Persistent variables with closures</u> in <u>perlsub</u>).
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
The userdata is held in a scalar, initialized from what you give in
<code>signal_connect</code> etc.  It&#39;s passed to the callback in usual Perl
&quot;call by reference&quot; style which means the callback can modify its last
argument, ie. $_[-1], to modify the held userdata.  This is a little
subtle, but you can use it for some &quot;state&quot; associated with the
connection.
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
    $widget-&gt;signal_connect (activate =&gt; \&amp;my_func, 1);
    sub my_func {
      print &quot;activation count: $_[-1]\n&quot;;
      $_[-1] ++;
    }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Because the held userdata is a new scalar there&#39;s no change to the
variable (etc) you originally passed to <code>signal_connect</code>.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
If you have a parent object in the userdata (or closure) you have to
be careful about circular references preventing parent and child being
destroyed.  See <u>Two-Phased Garbage Collection</u> in <u>perlobj</u> about this
generally.  In Gtk2-Perl toplevel widgets like <code>Gtk2::Window</code> always
need an explicit <code>$widget-&gt;destroy</code> so their <code>destroy</code> signal is
a good place to break circular references.  But for other widgets it&#39;s
usually friendliest to avoid circularities in the first place, either
by using weak references in the userdata, or possibly locating a
parent dynamically with <code>$widget-&gt;get_ancestor</code>.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
A major change from gtk-perl (the bindings for Gtk+-1.x) is that callbacks
take their arguments in the order proscribed by the C documentation, and only
one value is available for user data.  gtk-perl allowed you to pass multiple
values for user_data, and always brought in the user_data immediately after
the instance reference; this proved to be rather confusing, and did not follow
the C API reference, so we decided not to do that for gtk2-perl.
</p>
<h3 class="POD_HEAD2"><a name="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></h3>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
In C you can only return one value from a function, and it is a common practice
to modify pointers passed in to simulate returning multiple values.  In perl,
you can return lists; any functions which modify arguments have been changed
to return them instead.  A common idiom in gtk is returning gboolean, and 
modifying several arguments if the function returns TRUE; for such functions,
the perl wrapper just returns an empty list on failure.
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
  in C:  foo_get_baz_and_quux (foo, &amp;baz, &amp;quux);
  in perl:  ($baz, $quux) = $foo-&gt;get_baz_and_quux;
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Most things that take or return a GList, GSList, or array of values will use
native perl arrays (or the argument stack) instead.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
You don&#39;t need to specify string lengths, although string length
parameters should still be available for functions dealing with binary
strings. You can always use <code>substr</code> to pass different parts of a string.
</p>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
Anything that uses GError in C will <code>croak</code> on failure, setting $@ to a
magical exception object, which is overloaded to print as the
returned error message.  The ideology here is that GError is to be used
for runtime exceptions, and <code>croak</code> is how you do that in perl.  You can
catch a croak very easily by wrapping the function in an eval:
</p>
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
   eval {
      my $pixbuf = Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf-&gt;new_from_file ($filename);
      $image-&gt;set_from_pixbuf ($pixbuf);
   };
   if ($@) {
      print &quot;$@\n&quot;; # prints the possibly-localized error message
      if (Glib::Error::matches ($@, &#39;Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf::Error&#39;,
                                    &#39;unknown-format&#39;)) {
         change_format_and_try_again ();
      } elsif (Glib::Error::matches ($@, &#39;Glib::File::Error&#39;, &#39;noent&#39;)) {
         change_source_dir_and_try_again ();
      } else {
         # don&#39;t know how to handle this
         die $@;
      }
   }
</pre>
<p class="POD_TEXT">
This has the added advantage of letting you bunch things together as you would
with a try/throw/catch block in C++ -- you get cleaner code.  By using
Glib::Error exception objects, you don&#39;t have to rely on string matching
on a possibly localized error message; you can match errors by explicit and
predictable conditions.  See <a class="POD_LINK" href="../Glib/Error.html">Glib::Error</a> for more information.

As a general rule function that take a pair of parameters, a list and the
number of elements in that list, will normally omit the number of elements
and just accept a variable number of arguments that will be converted into
the list and number of elements.  In many instances parameters have been
reordered so that this will work.  See below for exceptions and specific
cases that are not detailed in the generated Perl API reference.

The C API for these functions requires a GtkWidget for the tab_label, since you
can set any widget you like to be the tab label.  However, the most common use
is a plain Gtk2::Label; so these three functions will stringify anything passed
to tab_label that&#39;s not a GtkWidget and wrap a Gtk2::Label around it for you.

Where a GClosure is wanted by the C stuff, a perl subroutine reference
suffices.  However, because of this, there are a few subtle differences in
sematics.  a GClosure may be connected to only one GtkAccelGroup; however, a
perl subroutine may be connected to many GtkAccelGroups (because at the binding
level, a new GClosure is created on each call to -&gt;connect).  Thus,
$accel_group-&gt;disconnect will disconnect the first group it finds to be
connected to the given perl subroutine.  To disconnect all groups attached to a
subroutine, you can call disconnect with the same subroutine reference (or
name) until it stops returning true.

In C, these functions take an array of GtkTargetEntries and the number of
elements in that array as the second and third parameters.  In Perl, the
number of target entries is implied by the number of items on the stack,
and the target entries are supplied as a list at the end of the parameter
list:
<pre class="POD_VERBATIM">
 $clipboard-&gt;set_with_data (\&amp;get_func, \&amp;clear_func, $user_data,
